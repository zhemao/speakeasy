Speakeasy: File Storage for the Paranoid
================================================

Given recent events such as SOPA, CISPA, the takedown of MegaUpload, it has
become clear that a new method of storing and sharing files online is required,
a method that protects the user from the prying eyes of governments, 
advertisers, media corporations, and anyone else seeking to violate the
privacy and fundamental rights of internet users. 

In the end, this can only be achieved by making the stored data inaccessible to
all but its owner, including the storage service provider. This can be done
using strong public-key encryption.

Other file lockers such as Dropbox do encrypt user's data, but in the end, they
all use symmetric ciphers and keep a copy of the shared secret, allowing them,
(or anyone who gains access to the key) to decrypt the user's files.

Speakeasy is different in that it uses RSA, a well-known public-key cipher. 
The server keeps a copy of the user's public key, and so is able to encrypt
data for the user, but it does not store the private key, and so cannot decrypt
the user's data. All transmission and storage of the file is fully encrypted,
meaning that the plain text of the file can only be seen on the user's computer,
using the user's private key. 

Speakeasy is designed for Red Hat's new OpenShift platform and uses MongoDB
with GridFS for storage.
